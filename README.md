# PQCisogenyGroupKey
The efficient implementation of supersingular isogeny group key agreement in C. This software includes the ephemeral three-party key establishment from isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves which are assumed to be resistant against quantum attacks. 
This library is implemented based on the SIDH library developed by Microsoft Research. A set of new functionalities are implemented to compute and evaluate the isogenies of degree-5.
